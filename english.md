With a windows iso file I made myself and with software that I have been researching for about 2.5 years, improving the computer I found on the internet, minimizing your input lag and increasing its performance, I optimize your computer without damaging your computer hardware.

* **How will your computer be optimized?**

> **[Package 1]** - Optimized with **V2OS**(Customized Windows 10) I made myself and together with V2PACK package. This will be the healthiest.<br>
**[Package 2]** - Buying the V2PACK package only. There may be no visible difference in FPS Increase.

* **What are your duties?**

> I will connect to your computer with Anydesk and take care of the necessary operations. If you bought Package 1, you may need to open the camera via discord as your PC will be formatted.

* **What will be the results after the package is completed?**

> Your Input Lag will be reduced to a minimum.
In addition to the FPS increase, your game will be more fluent. (Package differences may occur.)

* **A few features that V2PACK does:**

> It makes improvements on many hardware such as CPU / GPU(NVIDIA - AMD) / Internet / Ram / Storage by using the features already in your computer's settings without overclocking.
>
> In addition, it automatically turns off unimportant settings such as animations/privacy/background applications that I see as unnecessary in Windows;
Settings windows such as Windows Ethernet settings may not open, but you can make all settings from Control Panel.<br>
Printers & Scanners<br>
Windows Update<br>
Windows Defender

* **Not included in V2OS [Y - Re-downloadable.] / unavailable [X] apps/features:**
> Microsoft apps [Y] (Snipping Tool, Mail, Office, Phone, Wallet, Maps, 3D Builder, Cortana)<br>
Windows Defender [X]<br>
Windows Update [X]<br>
Printers & Scanners [X]<br>

* **Note:**

> **[1]** I don't do PC Optimization on LAPTOP and Intel GPU devices (because there is almost no difference.)<br>
**[2]** If you open a ticket and report the applications that you do not see among the applications that are not working above, I can get back to you.<br>
**[3]** If you say that there is no FPS difference in VALORANT game, your processor must be good.<br>
**[4]** If you say that there is no visible difference in other games, your system's hardware is low and as I said, I am trying to improve your PC with software. There is no overclocking process.<br>
**[5]** Also, if you are thinking of optimizing, you can open a #ticket and send me your computer hardware.<br>
